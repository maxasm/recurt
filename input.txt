The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, born out of a demand for justice and an end to racial violence, has grown to become one of the most influential modern civil rights movements. While it took root in the United States, its reverberations have been felt across the globe, underscoring the universal urgency to address racial disparities and systemic inequities. This powerful call to action is more than just a hashtag or a slogan; it is a plea for humanity, a demand for recognition, and a rallying cry for justice.
