The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed one of the most daunting public health challenges since its discovery in the early 1980s. Transmitted through blood, sexual contact, breast milk, and from an infected mother to her child during childbirth, HIV targets and damages the immune system, specifically the CD4 cells, leaving the infected individual vulnerable to opportunistic infections and diseases. When left untreated, HIV can progress to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a more severe and fatal stage. Globally, millions have lost their lives to AIDS-related illnesses, with Sub-Saharan Africa being the hardest hit. However, over the past four decades, significant strides have been made in understanding, treating, and preventing HIV/AIDS.
